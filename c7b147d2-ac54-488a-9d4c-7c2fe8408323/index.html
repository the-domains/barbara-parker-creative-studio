January 2016 marked the release of the second album “A Little Out
of Focus” on cdbaby (<a href="null">cdbaby.com/cd/barbaraparker2</a>)   The release
coincided with a performance at the iconic Mainstay in Rock Hall,
Maryland, alongside band members Joe Holt, Pres Harding and Ray
Anthony, with a very special appearance by Tom McHugh, who plays
harmonica on the title cut.  The album also features Diane Jones,
from Driven Women on banjo on Barbara’s composition “Loving Cup.”
 The diversity of the music is one of the surprises, with mostly
original material.</p><p>Barbara
says:</p><p>“This
project came out of taking an opportunity to work with Joe Holt on
arranging some of my original music. Joe is a fantastic pianist and
musician, and I was thrilled when he agreed to work with me. Then I
was honored to be offered a show at The Mainstay, a local venue that
has featured some fantastic performers over the years. Suddenly, the
work with Joe became a project and this album is the result. I was delighted
to work with Pres Harding and Ray Anthony , both on the cover songs
and original work, and am thrilled to have collaborated on one piece
with Grant Aldonas who sent me one beautiful piece, asking me to come
up with a lyric. I use words like "delighted" and
"thrilled" and "honored" because I truly am.”</p><h2>Reviews</h2><p><b>FOCUS on Parker Brilliance!</b></p><p>Millions of cds are released globally each year-all I feel sure with some degree of merit. What I WASN'T prepared for with Barbara Parker's  "A Little out of Focus" was an album which had me pretty much mesmerized from start to finish! Barbara's unique, emotional, warm voice notwithstanding, the songs run the full gamut of emotions, some storytelling, the odd cover done to perfection. But it is Barbara's original material which shines with strong melodic vocal lines, excellent lyrics/poetry and a healthy mixture of rhythms, moods going from ballads to a little gentle rocky/poppy/country - all we DIDN'T get was some heavy classical arias or sonatas!
For those with eclectic taste in music this album would certainly satisfy. Barbara's voice has a beautiful tone quality and superb range - she is inviting us on each track to listen to part of her story - so we smile with her, feel the romance with her, ride the crests of each wave of emotion and finish feeling satisfied - but hey! Play it again! Barbara has brilliant backing from Joe Holt, Pres Harding, Ray Anthony with features from Tom McHugh and Diane Jones. This album with it's intensity, fun,moods, brilliant songwriting and performances will be one you will play over and over -Outstanding music, performances, arrangements - not so out of focus after all!</p><p>Robyn Youlten, Wild Orchids, Melbourne, Australia.   </p><p><b>A Little out of Focus...is right in Focus</b></p><p>From ''I'm Not in the Mood'' that will most definitely put you ''in the mood'' all the way down to ''A Little out of Focus'' this album has it all.  For a real homespun sound with Vocals that never quit you are in for a treat with the purchase on Barbara's most recent release. There are a few timely cover's in the mix, however, the lions share of this album is new original works from the artist herself. This album was produced with meticulous observation to quality with results second to none. Loving Cup with the rest of this quality album will have you loving ''A Little out of Focus'' This will take you to a time when ''Music'' was real...a most enjoyable treat indeed.</p><p> Bob Warner, Brandon, Manitoba, Canada</p></div></article></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="42"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="44"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="45"><span data-reactid="46"><!-- react-empty: 47 --><h2 data-reactid="48"><a data-reactid="49">Barbara Parker Creative Studio</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="52"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="53"></div></section></div></div>
