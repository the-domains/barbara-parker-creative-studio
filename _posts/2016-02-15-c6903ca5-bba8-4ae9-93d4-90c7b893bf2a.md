The Paintings
![Confluence 2016  Multimedia on Canvas](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/54a3970b-d676-432f-a459-2f621b7689be.jpg)

As co-curator of the annual Abstract Show at the River Arts Gallery in Chestertown, 
Maryland, (along with my good friend Ronn Akins) it was important to find a way to 
somehow find a way to make my work fit the theme of "Confluence." The theme 
came about as the local writer's group worked to put the idea of confluence into 
words, giving abstract artists a special challenge to do the same. The art was then 
paired with the writings, crating a multi discipline and interesting show.
This work, represents an actual confluence as my various interests meet and flow 
into a diverse oeuvre that goes beyond painting, beyond my early days as a weaver, 
a silver jewelry designer and now a recording artist, all co-existing and layered in a 
way that makes every day an adventure and a choice of direction.
